### Summary
Iâ€™m a recent graduate passionate about using data to solve challenging problems and generate meaningful insights. My work spans diverse fields, including industry partnerships, neuroscience, coffee chemistry, and fitness optimization. From developing predictive models to identify high-risk days for emergency response to engineering iOS apps for personalized weightlifting recommendations, I thrive at the intersection of data science and innovation.

Specializing in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I have hands-on experience in Python, R, and Excel. My projects tackle real-world challenges, such as optimizing workflows through automation, uncovering hidden trends, and applying advanced analytics to practical solutions. Outside of coding projects and data analysis, I enjoy cooking, exercise, and spending time with puppy!
